    Description of the Model
    
    This model utilizes a combination of key batting and bowling statistics to predict
    the overall performance of a cricket player in an ODI match. The model is built on 
    historical data from 20th-century ODI players and applies machine learning techniques 
    to identify patterns in how these stats correlate with success in matches.

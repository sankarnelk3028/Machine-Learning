This project involves the development of an interactive web application, built using Streamlit, that predicts the performance of cricket players in One Day Internationals (ODIs). The model utilizes historical data from 20th-century ODI players to forecast future performance, with a focus on key batting and bowling statistics.

Prior to deploying the model, all processes, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, are completed within Visual Studio Code. The final solution consists of two core Python scripts: one for model creation and another for the frontend interface, which brings the prediction tool to life in a user-friendly web application.

This setup allows users to interact with the model and gain insights into player performance in a seamless and efficient manner.
